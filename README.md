**Lesson's topic:**

OOP basics: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.

**Technical task:**

1. Repeat writing classes from the lesson.
2. Create a document class with a date instead of a signature. And a separate class with date and signature. Redefine the print() method for all of them, by analogy with the example from the lesson. Call the print() method on all of them.
3. Add a method to the parent to save the file and call it on objects of descendant classes.

**Result:**
